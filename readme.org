* SymMat Implementation
See https://github.com/StewMH/GSoC2018/blob/master/evaluation_test.pdf for details

** Requirements
- =CMake=
- =C++11 Compiler=
- =Eigen3=

** Compilation 
To compile:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd build
cmake ..
make
#+END_SRC

And then to run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./symmat
#+END_SRC

Which should return:

=Test Passed=

Meaning the code at least works.

** Evaluation Test

Everything should be clearly laid out in =src/Main.cpp=

test/ just has some unit tests that were used for development,
they are not currently rigorous or clean.

** Personal Note

Thank you for looking over my (and hopefully other's) code.

Some compromises were made for the sake of getting the project done quicker.
Very little optimizations were done, and there is obviously a whole summers worth of code left out.
Hopefully, this code-base will see more work in the future.
If for some reason, it is found sub-par,
I would very much appreciate some tips/pointers to improve on it.

Thanks,
Aidan
